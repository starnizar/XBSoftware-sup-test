Looks like your code is correct, so advice is to check invoked methods onBeforeTaskAdd and onAfterTaskAdd.
Make sure that You use existing parrent's id.
And you always can read some more about that method in docs https://docs.dhtmlx.com/gantt/api__gantt_addtask.html

Hope, that was useful!

3. Hello, 'User'!

.showQuickInfo method is defined in the Quick Info extension, so you need to activate the quick_info (https://docs.dhtmlx.com/gantt/desktop__extensions_list.html#quickinfo) plugin.

Also .load method should accept'json', 'xml' or 'oldxml' type of data.
But if you use .php type, you should pass second parameter to method, type of string that describes a type you using. So something like that: http://snippet.dhtmlx.com/5/90d07db44
To get more info about methods you using here is a link to docs https://docs.dhtmlx.com/gantt/

Hope, that was usesful!
